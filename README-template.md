### Built with

### What I learned

In this project I was able to continue practicing my HTML and CSS skills. Something new that I learned was to set two images as background as follows:

```css
body {
    background: 
    url(/images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg) left top no-repeat, 
    url(/images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg) right bottom no-repeat;
    }
```

### Useful resources
